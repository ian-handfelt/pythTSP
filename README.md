# pythTSP
This is an ant colony optimization algorithm written in Python for traveling salesman problems.

This was an individual submission for a grade in a Software Development course at the University of Edinburgh.
Not all code is original. The assignment was to de-bug a nonfunctioning, poorly written, and comment-less piece of code and redesign it using the principals learned in Software Development.
